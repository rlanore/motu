/**
 * Indicates that an implementing class belongs to a fixed set that may be treated as an enumeration. Each
 * instance of the class gives rise to an &quot;enum-like&quot; constant that can be used as a convenient
 * representative for the underlying object.
 * <p>
 * Useful in situations when a Java <code>Enum</code> cannot be used, e.g. if the set of enumerated values is
 * not known in advance and/or may change at runtime.
 * <p>
 * If the enum constants are of a non-primitive type, instances of this class should preferably only be
 * obtainable from a {@link DynamicEnum} factory, to reduce the risk of invalid enum values.
 * <p>
 * As enum constants, instances of the class are implicitly comparable. To compare two instances <i><u>as enum
 * constants</u></i>, use {@link DynamicEnum#compare(Object, Object)}. For a <code>Comparable</code> enum
 * constant type, the results of <code>compare(e1, e2)</code> should ideally match
 * <code>e1.compareTo(e2)</code>, but this is not guaranteed.
